* So what would I want to de better next time?
Better commit comments. No matter how much you put it's never enough. But this time around I really skimped. 
Checking in Before and after each test isn't really normal and likely contributed to the lack of commit messages.

* What dont I like?
The resolution toward the end for handling overlap time. To much complexity came in and its something a quick chat 
with the stake holders could have fixed. Without that conversation the overlap time should be based on which rate is higher not hard coded 
to assume Midnight Time > Kids Awake > Kids Asleep. Put in a bunch of energy to allow the rates to change only to hamsting it with the overlap logic.

* Outcome
Really enjoyed it. Havent developed just for the art of it in a while and forgot how much fun it can be.
